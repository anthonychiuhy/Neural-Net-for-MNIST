# Neural-Net-for-MNIST
Using a simple Neural Network to classify MNIST data.

Feed forward fully connected artificial neural network for classification of handwritten digits data from MNIST using tanh as activation.

Minimising the loss function using stochastic gradient descent.

The script shows that even with a relatively simple neural network with one hidden layer and few nodes could classify the digits quite accurately (>90 % for test set).

The full set of training and testing hand written digits data from MNIST must be present for the Python script to run.
